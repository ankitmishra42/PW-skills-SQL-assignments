        "\n",
        "- A CTE is a temporary, named result set that you can reference within a single SQL statement. It's defined using the WITH clause.\n",
        "- How it improves readability:\n",
        "  - CTEs help split a complex query into small, logical steps, making it easier to read, understand, and debug.\n",
        "  - Meaningful CTE names clearly describe what each sub-query does, making the SQL easier to read and understand without extra comments.\n",
        "  - A CTE lets us define a subquery once and reuse it multiple times, reducing repetition and making the query cleaner and easier to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q2. Why are some views updatable while others are read-only? Explain with an example.**\n",
        "\n",
        "- A view is a virtual table created from a SQL query. A view is updatable only if the database can clearly apply changes made to the view back to the original table\n",
        "\n",
        "- A view is generally updatable when:\n",
        "  - It is based on a single base table.\n",
        "  - It includes the primary key of that table.\n",
        "  - It does not use aggregate functions, GROUP BY, HAVING, DISTINCT, UNION, or joins.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A view is generally read-only when:\n",
        "  - It is based on multiple base tables (joins).\n",
        "  - It uses aggregate functions, GROUP BY, HAVING, DISTINCT, UNION.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "  CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",

        "\n",
        "- Stored procedures are pre-compiled SQL code blocks that are stored in the database. It makes database operations more efficient, secure, and easier to manage in large applications.\n",
        "- They offer several advantages over repeatedly writing raw SQL queries:\n",
        "  - Reusability\n",
        "  - Better Performance\n",

        "**Q4. What is the purpose of triggers in a database? Mention one use case where a trigger is essential.**\n",
        "\n",
        "- A trigger is a database object that automatically executes a predefined action when a specific event occurs on a table, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The main purpose of triggers is to enforce business rules, maintain data integrity, and automate actions at the database level without manual intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Why this is essential:<br>\n",
        "  - Because the logic runs inside the database, it works consistently for all applications accessing the data and cannot be bypassed easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q5. Explain the need for data modelling and normalization when designing a database.**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data modelling helps define how data is structured, related, and stored in a database before implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - It ensures the database accurately represents real-world entities and their relationships.\n",
        "  - It helps avoid design mistakes early, making the system easier to maintain and scale.\n",
        "- Normalization is used to organize data efficiently by reducing redundancy and dependency.\n",
        "  - It prevents duplicate data and improves data consistency.\n",
        "  - It avoids update, insert, and delete anomalies.\n",
        "  - It makes the database easier to maintain and keeps data accurate."
